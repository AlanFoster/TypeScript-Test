TypeScript Test
================

##What is this?##
This was just a basic test to see how well TypeScript can be used for "application-scale" development. The end result of the project was a very basic blogging system with basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

I wasn't sure where to take this test project originally, but I was inspired a lot by [hawt.io](https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio) to make use of both Grunt and AngularJs. Which eventually led me to make a basic blog system.

I would definitely like to make use of these technologies in future projects and couldn't recommend them more!

## Core Dependencies ##
- [AngularJs](http://angularjs.org/) - I hadn't planned to use this framework initially, but after I saw the the [hawt.io](https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio) webconsole I was very impressed by it and wanted to use AngularJs, and I'm glad I did. It provides a very nice double-binding system, and it has got some really awesome concepts. The Dependency Injection method is just utterly brilliant, I can't wait to play around with it more
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - A very nice task based build tool (Basically Maven/Ant for JavaScript). It provides a very nice task called 'watch' which listens for code changes automatically, which when combined with the TypeScript compile task, allows for very fast development speeds!
- [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A superset of Javascript which gives you the ability to optionally add type information to JavaScript, it also has a bunch of sugar and ES6 spec implementations which is very nice! You should try out the TypeScript playground and see how brilliant it is :)
